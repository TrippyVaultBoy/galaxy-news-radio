    Vault 76 Completed, Celebrates Grand Opening in Honor of America’s Tercentenary

CHARLESTON, WV – On this historic July 4th, as fireworks thunder across the skies and proud Americans gather from coast to coast, Vault-Tec Corporation has announced the ceremonial completion and official opening of Vault 76, its flagship vault facility built to honor the 300th anniversary of the founding of the United States of America. The vault—constructed just outside Charleston, West Virginia—was unveiled in a star-spangled ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by state officials, Vault-Tec executives, and representatives from the Department of Civil Preparedness. Patriotic music, stirring speeches, and a demonstration of Vault-Tec's cutting-edge security systems capped off the event, which was broadcast nationwide on GNN. “This isn’t just a shelter—it’s a symbol,” said Genevieve Hastings, Vault-Tec’s Regional Overseer of Appalachian Operations. “Vault 76 represents the hope, resilience, and unbreakable spirit of the American people. Should the worst ever come to pass, this vault—and the men and women within—will ensure our nation’s survival and eventual rebirth.”
                            
    Designed to Rebuild America
                            
Unlike some of Vault-Tec’s more specialized facilities, Vault 76 is classified as a “Control Vault,” designed to house 500 of the nation’s best and brightest citizens. Selected for their leadership potential, technical skills, and cultural values, the residents of Vault 76 are intended to emerge only 20 years after total nuclear deployment, tasked with rebuilding society. According to Vault-Tec, Vault 76 features:
                            
        State-of-the-art environmental systems
                            
        Fully automated food production and hydroponics labs
                        
        Classrooms, recreation facilities, and morale support centers
                            
        Military-grade survival training programs
                            
    “This vault is not about hiding from the world,” said Vault-Tec spokesman Dr. Elias Stone. “It’s about preparing to restore it. Vault 76 is not just a shelter. It’s a launching pad for the next chapter of America.”
                            
    A Select Few: Hand-Picked for the Future
                            
Although exact resident rosters are classified, it is widely believed that several former military officers, engineers, medical professionals, and emerging leaders in technology have been assigned to the vault. West Virginia Governor Clayton Ridge praised the vault’s selection process, calling it “a shining example of government-private sector collaboration to ensure our civilization’s continuation.”
                            
    Public Reactions Mixed
                            
While many citizens expressed pride and excitement, critics argue that Vault-Tec’s selective admission criteria leave too many behind. “This whole thing reeks of elitism,” said local resident Debra Kohler, watching the ribbon-cutting from outside the cordoned-off viewing area. “What about the rest of us? Where’s our vault?” Vault-Tec officials declined to comment on individual admission decisions but reiterated their commitment to “protecting as many American lives as operational logistics allow.”
                            
    Countdown to Reclamation Day
                            
Though Vault 76’s doors are now ceremonially open, its full closure protocols are scheduled to go into effect within the next six months. A countdown to ‘Reclamation Day’—the scheduled reopening two decades post-attack—was initiated today, marked by the activation of the Vault’s chronometer. Vault-Tec assures that, should the unthinkable occur, Vault 76’s citizens will be ready. “We built this nation once,” said Dr. Stone. “And when the time comes, we will build it again.”</pre>
