Custom Frontend From Scratch (Final T3 Project)

For this project Max tasked us with creating a frontend from scratch aroound the theme of "Music"!

I wanted to create a news and radio style website themed around my favorite video game series Fallout!

The site was built using Bootstrap asn is fully responsive working on Desktop Tablet and Mobile Devices.
I also implemented a custom Live Radio complete with audio files straight from fallout 3! The Radio controls
were built with javascript and jQuery and are fully Dynamic and the song title, artist name and artist image
change when each song starts playing. The site features a full page of in-universe news stories and each
one is clickable linking to a new page.

For this project the three components i used were:
- Boostrap
- Responsive
- and custom live radio
